== Unit eval

This unit has support for evaluation and macro-handling. This unit is used
by default, unless the program is compiled with the {{-explicit-use}}
option.

=== Eval

==== eval

<procedure>(eval EXP [ENVIRONMENT])</procedure>

Evaluates {{EXP}} and returns the result of the evaluation. The second argument is optional
and defaults to the value of {{(interaction-environment)}}.

'''Note''': if you want to eval an expression containing chicken special forms you must

  (use chicken-syntax)

before calling {{eval}}.
