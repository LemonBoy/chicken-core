== Unit repl

This unit provides CHICKEN's read-print-eval loop.


=== repl

<procedure>(repl [EVALUATOR])</procedure>

Start a new read-eval-print loop. Sets the {{reset-handler}} so that
any invocation of {{reset}} restarts the read-eval-print loop. Also
changes the current exception-handler to display a message, write
any arguments to the value of {{(current-error-port)}} and reset.

If {{EVALUATOR}} is given, it should be a procedure of one argument that
is used in place of {{eval}} to evaluate each entered expression.

You can use {{quit}} to terminate the current read-eval-print loop.


=== repl-prompt

<parameter>(repl-prompt)</parameter>

A procedure that should evaluate to a string that will be printed before
reading interactive input from the user in a read-eval-print loop.
Defaults to {{(lambda () "#;N> ")}}.
